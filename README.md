# Jason_Saltenis_MineSweeper
THE BEST MINESWEEPER GAME ON THIS SIDE OF THE NEBLON SYSTEM!

This is the first project I ever made with programming. It's funny to see the mistakes I made that I would not make this time around.

How to run it:
1) Download it from the git
2) Extract the zip file
3) Open up command prompt in admin mode
4) Navigate to the minesweeper folder (using cd [location])
5) Type "npx serve"
	It will ask if it can install the serve packages (not a typo)
6) Once it's installed it will tell you the local host port eg. "http://localhost:3000"
7) Enter that local host address into your web browser of choice.
8) Play and have fun! 



Controls:

Left mouse click is select the cell
